Repository for docs pertaining to our Enterprise Neurosystem AI ML governance model 

This repository will be used to keep track of meetings and discussions in the working group of governance for the enterprise neurosystem platform, and the files presented in the meetings.

The content deck would typically be the version refelcting all changes and modifications present after the meeting was held.

The goal of the governance team is to present a set of easy to use/understand standards that will not impede code development.
